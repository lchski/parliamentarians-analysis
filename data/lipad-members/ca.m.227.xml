He ran again in the 1980 election and won, serving as a backbencher under Pierre Trudeau and as a parliamentary secretary from 1981 to 1983. He supported John Turner's successful bid to succeed Trudeau in the 1984 Liberal leadership contest but lost his seat in the 1984 election. He was returned to Parliament as a result of the 1988 election and was re-elected in each subsequent election until his retirement in 2007. In 1997, Jean Chrétien appointed him to the Ministry as Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), but Peterson was sent back to the backbench in 2002.
